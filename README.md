# Abstract:
Objective and Methodology
This dissertation investigates the application of super-resolution (SR) techniques in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for speech production studies aiming to address MRI challenges like artifacts and resolution trade-offs. The methodology involved simulating various MRI artifacts in low-resolution images for the evaluation of SR techniques.

Comparative Analysis of SR Models
Three state-of-the-art super resolution (SR) models - SwinIR, MSRResNet, and DnCNN - were compared using quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM) and qualitative assessments. MSRResNet showed the best quantitative improvements, particularly in handling various artifacts, but sometimes introduced bright spots that could lead to misinterpretations. SwinIR and DnCNN, despite some limitations, effectively preserved organ representation in specific scenarios.

Conclusion and Future Directions
The study highlights the need for improved SR evaluation metrics that align with human visual perception and the importance of qualitative analysis. These findings contribute to the advancement of MRI quality in speech production research, with implications for linguistic theory and medical practice.
